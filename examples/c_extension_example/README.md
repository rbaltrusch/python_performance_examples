# C-extension example

This example speeds up the library function considerably by implementing it completely in C as a C-extension for Python. It runs about times faster than the base example written in vanilla Python.

# How to run example

From the project root directory, change into this example folder and run the `src` python package:

```
cd examples/c_extension_example
python -m src
```
